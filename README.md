## ✨ Features

### 🔬 Explorer Mode
- **Interactive SVG cell** with realistic organelles and gradients
- **Animal/Plant toggle** - switch between cell types (cell wall, chloroplasts, central vacuole)
- **Detailed organelle information** - function, structure, fun facts, and memory cards
- **Progress tracking** - monitors which organelles you've explored

### 🎮 Quiz Mode (20 Questions)
- **20 questions** organized by categories: Organelles, Membrane, Transport, Cytoskeleton, Cell Types
- **Scoring system** with streak bonus points
- **Topic filtering** - practice only what you need to review
- **Immediate feedback** with educational explanations
- **Final results** with medals and badges

### 🏗️ Builder Mode
- **Build your own cell** by adding organelles one by one
- **Realistic visuals** - each organelle has its own shape, color, and details (mitochondrial cristae, ribosomes on RER, etc.)
- **Hint system** to guide users
- **Celebration upon completion**

### ⚖️ Compare Mode
- **Comparative table** of Prokaryotic vs. Eukaryotic cells
- **SVG visualization** of relative sizes
- **11 characteristics** compared point by point
